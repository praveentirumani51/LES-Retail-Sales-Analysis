# LES Retail Sales Analysis (Excel + SQL)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes a **sample dataset of 50 customers** from LES Retail to generate insights on **sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends**.  
Since the dataset is small, a **summary report with visuals** was created instead of a full dashboard.

## Key Insights
- **Top Customers** → 10 customers contributed the majority of revenue.  
- **City Performance** → Bangalore and Kanpur had higher ARPU, while Mumbai had high sales but lower ARPU.  
- **Product Insights** → Cornflakes (1Kg) was the best-selling product. Larger packs outperformed smaller packs.  
- **Business Strategy** → High-value customers and premium cities should be targeted with loyalty programs and upselling.

##  Skills & Tools Used
- **Excel** → Data cleaning, Pivot Tables, Charts  
- **SQL** → Aggregations, Grouping, Filtering

##  Project Deliverables
- **Excel Report** with summary tables and charts  
- **SQL Queries** for aggregations and ARPU calculations

##  Future Improvements
- Scale the analysis with more customer data  
- Build an **interactive Power BI/Tableau dashboard** for drill-down insights  
- Add **time-series analysis** for tracking sales trends over weeks/months
